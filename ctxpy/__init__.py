ctx-python
=====

Provides a Python interface with EPA's Office of Research and Development, Center for
Computational Toxicology and Exposure's Application Programming Interface (API)
  2. Fast mathematical operations over arrays
  3. Linear Algebra, Fourier Transforms, Random Number Generation

How to use the documentation
----------------------------
Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided
with the code.

We recommend exploring the docstrings using
`IPython <https://ipython.org>`_, an advanced Python shell with
TAB-completion and introspection capabilities.  See below for further
instructions.

The docstring examples assume that `ctxpy` has been imported as ctx:

  >>> import ctxpy as ctx

Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs::

  >>> c = ctx.Chemical()
  >>> c.search(by='equals',word='toluene')

Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring:

  >>> help(ctx.Chemical)

Viewing documentation using IPython
-----------------------------------

Start IPython and import `ctx-python`: `import ctxpy as ctx`. Then, directly paste or 
use the ``%cpaste`` magic to paste examples into the shell. To see which functions are 
available in `ctx-python`, type ``ctx.<TAB>`` (where ``<TAB>`` refers to the TAB key) To 
view the  docstring for a function, use ``ctx.Chemical?<ENTER>`` (to view the docstring) 
and ``ctx.Chemical??<ENTER>`` (to view the source code).
